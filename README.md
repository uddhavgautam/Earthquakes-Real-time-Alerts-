Distributed, multitasking, real-time, and parallel operations are the needs for the complex tasks best automation process. For the single task, a single high speed processor core can provide real-time responses. And for the multitasking, the pseudo parallelism, achieved from threads shared among processor cores, provides the real-time responses. If not the independent task, two processes when work on unison can produce the better effect than the sum of their individual effects. This synergy (Wikipedia contributors 2017) concept pulls the concept that the interrelated tasks should be distributed. 

The best automation is the function of distribution, multitasking, real-time, and parallel operations.  But still, it is not sufficient. In fact, the best automation is the output of best communication which is the function of distribution, multitasking, real-time, and parallel operations. What is the best communication for the optimal result has been the challenge for computer scientists from several years. Because it keeps depends on the problem domain, and it keeps enhancing based on the new upgraded tools and technology. 

Real-time applications have several advantages in several domains (“Google” 2017). The “Earthquakes Notification Tool” is a real-time, distributed android application which deals in “Earthquakes” domain. 

Fetching the live-earthquakes and throwing real-time alerts to user and the emergency contacts is critical in earthquake risk zones. The robust tool equipped with latest tools and technology is needed to better solve this issue. This is why “Earthquakes Notification Tool” introduced. And this tool solves this issue by integrating several modules such as: Google Firebase CDN (“Firebase | App Success Made Simple” 2017), Dynamic-Resource-Frequency-Checker (“Dynamic-Resource-UpdateChecker - Android Apps on Google Play” 2017a) for USGS JSON resource, Continuous-Location-Tracker, Contacts-Sync-Module, Observer pattern for the Google CDN JSON. The “Earthquakes Notification Tool” is best because each modules are optimized and the communication logic is optimized.
